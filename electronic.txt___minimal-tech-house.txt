Minimal tech house is a subgenre of electronic dance music that features stripped-down, repetitive beats and minimalistic melodies. It often incorporates elements of techno and house music, with a focus on creating a hypnotic, groove-based sound. The genre is characterized by its use of sparse instrumentation and a focus on rhythm and texture, rather than melody or harmony. Minimal tech house tracks are typically designed for the dancefloor, with a driving, energetic feel that encourages movement and immersion in the music. (AI Generated)
