Subliminal product music is a genre of music that incorporates hidden messages or affirmations intended to influence the listener's thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. These messages are often embedded within the music at a low volume or frequency, making them difficult to consciously detect. The goal of subliminal product music is to subtly persuade the listener to adopt certain beliefs or behaviors without their awareness. (AI Generated)
