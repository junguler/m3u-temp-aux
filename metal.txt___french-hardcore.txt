French hardcore music is a subgenre of punk rock that emerged in the late 1970s and gained popularity in the 1980s. It is characterized by fast-paced, aggressive music with heavy guitar riffs and shouted vocals. The lyrics often deal with social and political issues, as well as personal struggles. Rise Of The Northstar, Birds in Row, and Pilori are all examples of modern French hardcore bands that continue to push the boundaries of the genre. Their music is energetic and intense, with a raw and authentic sound that captures the spirit of the French hardcore scene. (AI Generated)
