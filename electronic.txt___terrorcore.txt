It is characterized by its aggressive and fast-paced beats, distorted synthesizers, and heavy use of samples from horror films and other sources. The lyrics often deal with themes of violence, terrorism, and the occult. The genre has a strong following in the Netherlands, where it originated, and has since spread to other parts of Europe. Its most prominent artists are known for their high-energy live performances and their use of pyrotechnics and other special effects. (AI Generated)
