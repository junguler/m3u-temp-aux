Belarusian indie music is a genre that blends post-punk, new wave, and electronic music with lyrics that often touch on themes of social commentary and personal introspection. The music is characterized by its raw, lo-fi sound and melancholic melodies that evoke a sense of nostalgia. The genre has gained popularity in recent years thanks to the rise of bands such as Molchat Doma, Lyapis Trubetskoy, and saypink!, who have helped to put Belarusian indie music on the map.
