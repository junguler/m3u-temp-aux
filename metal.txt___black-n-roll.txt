It is characterized by fast-paced, aggressive riffs, distorted guitar tones, and raw, unpolished production. The vocals are typically harsh and raspy, and the lyrics often deal with themes of darkness, nihilism, and anti-religion. The genre emerged in the early 2000s and has gained popularity in the underground metal scene. (AI Generated)
