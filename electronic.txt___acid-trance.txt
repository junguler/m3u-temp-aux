Acid trance tracks typically have a fast tempo, driving basslines, and repetitive, hypnotic melodies. The genre is known for its energetic and euphoric sound, and has been popular in the rave and club scenes. Some of the most notable acid trance tracks were produced by artists such as Future Breeze, Binary Finary, and Emmanuel Top. (AI Generated)
