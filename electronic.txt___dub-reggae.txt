Dub reggae is a subgenre of reggae music that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. It is characterized by heavy basslines, drum and bass rhythms, and the use of effects such as echo and reverb. Dub reggae often features instrumental versions of popular songs, with emphasis on the rhythm section and the manipulation of sound. It has since spread worldwide and continues to evolve with new artists and producers adding their own unique spin to the genre. (AI Generated)
