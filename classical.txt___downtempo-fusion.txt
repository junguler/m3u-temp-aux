Downtempo fusion is a genre of music that combines elements of electronic, ambient, and trip-hop music. It is characterized by its slow and relaxed tempo, atmospheric soundscapes, and the use of live instrumentation. The genre often incorporates samples from various sources, including nature sounds, speeches, and movie dialogue. The music is often introspective and contemplative, with a focus on creating a mood or atmosphere rather than a traditional song structure. (AI Generated)
