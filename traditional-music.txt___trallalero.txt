Trallalero music is a traditional style of polyphonic singing from Liguria, Italy. It is characterized by the use of four voices (bass, baritone, tenor, and alto) and a rhythmic accompaniment. The songs are often sung a cappella and feature complex harmonies and vocal arrangements. I Giovani Canterini di Sant'Olcese, La Squadra (compagnia Del Trallalero), and I cantori di Marsaglia are all groups that perform trallalero music and are known for their skill and dedication to preserving this unique musical tradition.
