Trash rock is a subgenre of rock music that is characterized by its raw and gritty sound, often incorporating elements of garage rock, punk, and surf rock. The music is typically fast-paced and energetic, with distorted guitars, pounding drums, and aggressive vocals. Trash rock bands often draw inspiration from vintage rock and roll and 1960s garage bands, but add their own unique twist to create a sound that is both retro and modern. The genre is known for its DIY ethos and rebellious attitude, and has gained a cult following among fans of underground rock music. (AI Generated)
