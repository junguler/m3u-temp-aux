Dreamgaze is a subgenre of shoegaze that combines the atmospheric, dreamy soundscapes of shoegaze with the ethereal, dreamlike qualities of dream pop. It often features heavily distorted guitars, hazy vocals, and layers of reverb and delay effects. The genre is characterized by its dreamy, otherworldly sound that transports listeners to a surreal, introspective state. (AI Generated)
