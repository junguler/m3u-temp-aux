Ritual ambient music is a genre that focuses on creating a haunting and otherworldly atmosphere through the use of droning sounds, field recordings, and dark ambient textures. The music often incorporates elements of tribal and shamanic rituals, as well as occult and esoteric themes. It is meant to transport the listener to a different realm and induce a meditative or trance-like state. (AI Generated)
