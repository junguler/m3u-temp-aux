Dub poetry is a music genre that emerged in the 1970s, blending spoken word poetry with reggae rhythms and dub music production techniques. The lyrics often address social and political issues, such as racism, poverty, and oppression, and are delivered in a rhythmic, poetic style. Dub poetry artists use their voices as instruments, often incorporating Jamaican patois and other dialects into their performances. The genre has been influential in the development of hip hop and spoken word poetry, and has produced some of the most powerful and socially conscious music of the past few decades. (AI Generated)
