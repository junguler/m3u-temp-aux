German hardcore music is a subgenre of punk rock that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Germany. It is characterized by its aggressive and fast-paced sound, often featuring heavy guitar riffs and shouted vocals. The lyrics often deal with social and political issues, as well as personal struggles. Bands in this genre often incorporate elements of metal and crossover thrash into their music.
