Garage rock revival is a music genre that emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s, characterized by its raw and energetic sound reminiscent of the 1960s garage rock scene. The genre is often associated with stripped-down instrumentation, heavily distorted guitar riffs, and aggressive vocals. Its revival in the 21st century has seen a resurgence of interest in the genre, with bands incorporating elements of punk, blues, and rock and roll. (AI Generated)
