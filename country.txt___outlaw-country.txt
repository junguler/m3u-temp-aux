Outlaw country is a subgenre of country music that emerged in the 1960s and 70s. It is characterized by a rebellious attitude and a rejection of the polished, mainstream sound of Nashville. Outlaw country artists often incorporate elements of rock and roll, blues, and folk into their music, and their lyrics often deal with themes of hard living, heartbreak, and social commentary. The genre has experienced a resurgence in recent years with the rise of artists who continue to push the boundaries of traditional country music. (AI Generated)
