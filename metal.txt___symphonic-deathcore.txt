Symphonic deathcore is a subgenre of metal that combines the aggressive and heavy sound of deathcore with the grandiose and epic elements of symphonic music. The genre is characterized by the use of orchestral instruments, such as strings and horns, alongside traditional metal instrumentation. The vocals are typically harsh and guttural, with occasional clean singing and spoken word passages. The lyrics often deal with dark and violent themes, such as death, destruction, and the occult. Symphonic deathcore bands often incorporate complex song structures and technical instrumentation, creating a dynamic and intense listening experience. (AI Generated)
