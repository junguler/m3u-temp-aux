Coldwave is a subgenre of post-punk and new wave that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is characterized by its dark, atmospheric sound, often incorporating elements of electronic music and industrial music. The lyrics often deal with themes of isolation, despair, and alienation. Coldwave bands typically use synthesizers, drum machines, and other electronic instruments to create a haunting, melancholic sound. Some of the key features of coldwave include sparse, minimalist arrangements, icy vocals, and a focus on texture and mood rather than melody. (AI Generated)
