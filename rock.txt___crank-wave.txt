Crank wave is a subgenre of punk rock that emerged in the early 2010s. It is characterized by its raw and aggressive sound, often featuring distorted guitars, heavy basslines, and pounding drums. The lyrics are typically politically charged and deal with issues such as social inequality, mental health, and the state of the world. Crank wave bands often incorporate elements of post-punk and garage rock into their music, creating a unique and energetic sound that is both cathartic and empowering. (AI Generated)
