Indonesian shoegaze is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged in the late 2000s. It is characterized by its dreamy and ethereal sound, often featuring heavily distorted guitars and hazy vocals. The genre draws influence from classic shoegaze bands such as My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive, as well as Indonesian traditional music. The lyrics often explore themes of love, longing, and nostalgia. Some notable bands in the genre include Bedchamber, Themilo, and Polyester Embassy. (AI Generated)
