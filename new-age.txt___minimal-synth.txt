Minimal synth is a subgenre of electronic music characterized by its stripped-down, simplistic approach to composition. It often features sparse, repetitive rhythms and melodies, with a focus on creating a hypnotic, trance-like atmosphere. The genre emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with many artists using analog synthesizers and drum machines to create their sound. Today, minimal synth continues to be a popular genre among underground electronic music fans, with artists experimenting with new sounds and techniques. (AI Generated)
