Sound collage is a genre of music that involves the manipulation and layering of various sounds and samples to create a unique sonic experience. It often incorporates elements of found sound, field recordings, and spoken word, and can range from chaotic and abrasive to soothing and meditative. This genre challenges traditional notions of melody and harmony, and encourages listeners to engage with sound in a more abstract and experimental way. (AI Generated)
