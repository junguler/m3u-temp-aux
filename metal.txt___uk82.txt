UK82 is a subgenre of punk rock that emerged in the United Kingdom in the early 1980s. It is characterized by its aggressive and fast-paced sound, politically charged lyrics, and DIY ethos. The music often features distorted guitars, pounding drums, and shouted vocals. The genre was influenced by earlier punk bands such as the Sex Pistols and the Clash, but also drew inspiration from the emerging hardcore punk scene in the United States. UK82 bands often had a strong anti-establishment and anti-authoritarian message, and their music was associated with the anarchist and socialist movements of the time. (AI Generated)
