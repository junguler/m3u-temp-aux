Baroque pop is a music genre that combines elements of classical music with pop and rock. It is characterized by its use of orchestral instruments such as strings, horns, and harpsichords, as well as complex arrangements and harmonies. The lyrics often explore themes of love, loss, and spirituality, and the vocals are typically dramatic and emotive. The genre emerged in the 1960s and has since been popularized by various artists who have added their own unique twists to the style. (AI Generated)
