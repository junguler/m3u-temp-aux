Spanish prog music is a genre that emerged in the 1970s and combines elements of rock, jazz, and traditional Spanish music. It is characterized by complex arrangements, virtuosic instrumental performances, and poetic lyrics that often address social and political issues. The genre reached its peak of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s, with bands like Medina Azahara, Triana, and Itoiz gaining a large following. Their music is known for its fusion of flamenco and Andalusian folk music with progressive rock, creating a unique sound that is distinctly Spanish. (AI Generated)
