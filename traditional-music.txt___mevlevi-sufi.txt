Mevlevi sufi music is a traditional genre of music that is deeply rooted in the Islamic mystical tradition of Sufism. It is characterized by its use of traditional instruments such as the ney, the kudum, and the tanbur, as well as its distinctive vocal style. The music is often accompanied by whirling dervishes who perform a ritual dance known as the sema. The music is intended to induce a state of trance and spiritual ecstasy in the listener, and is often used in religious ceremonies and rituals. (AI Generated)
