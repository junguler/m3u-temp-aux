Lo-fi jazzhop is a subgenre of hip-hop that blends the smooth and mellow sounds of jazz with the raw and gritty production techniques of lo-fi music. It often features dusty vinyl samples, laid-back beats, and jazzy instrumentation such as saxophones, trumpets, and pianos. The genre has a nostalgic and introspective feel, evoking a sense of relaxation and contemplation. Artists in this genre often use pseudonyms to maintain anonymity and focus on the music rather than their personal brand. (AI Generated)
