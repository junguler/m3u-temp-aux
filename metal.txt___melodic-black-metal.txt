Melodic black metal is a subgenre of black metal that incorporates elements of melody and harmony into its typically aggressive and dark sound. It often features atmospheric and symphonic elements, as well as complex guitar riffs and solos. The vocals are usually harsh and raspy, and the lyrics often deal with themes of darkness, nature, and mythology. Bands in this genre often use keyboards and orchestral arrangements to create a grandiose and epic sound. (AI Generated)
