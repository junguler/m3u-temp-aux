Underground grunge is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is characterized by its heavy, distorted guitar sound, angst-filled lyrics, and raw, unpolished production. The genre often deals with themes of alienation, social isolation, and disillusionment. Bands in this genre typically have a DIY ethos and reject mainstream commercialism. The music is often associated with the Pacific Northwest, particularly Seattle, where it gained popularity in the early 1990s. (AI Generated)
