Norwegian death metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that emerged in Norway in the late 1980s. It is characterized by its aggressive and fast-paced sound, with heavy use of distorted guitars, blast beats, and guttural vocals. The lyrics often deal with dark and violent themes, including death, Satanism, and anti-Christianity. Bands in this genre typically have a raw and unpolished sound, with a focus on creating a brutal and intense atmosphere. (AI Generated)
