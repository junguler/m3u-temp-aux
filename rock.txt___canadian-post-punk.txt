Canadian post-punk is a genre of music that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is characterized by its dark and moody sound, often featuring heavy basslines, angular guitar riffs, and driving rhythms. The genre has seen a resurgence in recent years with bands incorporating elements of new wave, shoegaze, and industrial music. The lyrics often touch on themes of isolation, alienation, and societal critique. (AI Generated)
