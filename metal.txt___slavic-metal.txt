Slavic metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music that incorporates traditional Slavic folk music elements, such as the use of traditional instruments like the hurdy-gurdy and bagpipes, and lyrics that often draw inspiration from Slavic mythology and folklore. The music is characterized by its heavy, distorted guitar riffs, pounding drums, and aggressive vocals, often contrasted with more melodic and atmospheric passages. The genre has gained popularity in recent years, with bands from countries like Poland, Ukraine, and Russia gaining international recognition for their unique sound and cultural identity.
