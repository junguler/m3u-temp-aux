Canadian stoner rock is a heavy and riff-driven genre that combines elements of classic rock, doom metal, and psychedelic rock. The music is characterized by distorted guitar tones, pounding drums, and powerful vocals, often with lyrics that explore themes of escapism, rebellion, and the darker side of human nature. The genre has gained a strong following in recent years, with bands like We Hunt Buffalo, Anciients, and Doom's Day leading the charge with their unique sound and energetic live performances.
