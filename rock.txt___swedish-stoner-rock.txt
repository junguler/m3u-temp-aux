Swedish stoner rock is a subgenre of rock music that emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It is characterized by heavy, distorted guitar riffs, bluesy melodies, and psychedelic influences. The music often has a vintage sound and draws inspiration from classic rock bands of the 60s and 70s. The lyrics often deal with themes of mysticism, nature, and the occult. The genre has gained popularity in recent years, with bands like Graveyard, Witchcraft, and Blues Pills leading the way. (AI Generated)
