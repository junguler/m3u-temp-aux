It is characterized by its heavy use of samples, boom bap beats, and socially conscious lyrics that often touch on themes such as poverty, crime, and political corruption. The genre is known for its raw, unpolished sound and its emphasis on lyrical skill and authenticity. Artists in this genre often rap in a gritty, streetwise style, and their music is often associated with the underground rap scene. (AI Generated)
