Post-minimalism is a music genre that emerged in the late 20th century as a reaction to the strict rules of minimalism. It retains the repetitive patterns and tonal harmonies of minimalism but adds more emotional depth and complexity. The genre often features classical instruments, electronic elements, and vocals. The music is characterized by its use of extended techniques, unconventional structures, and experimental soundscapes. It is often associated with film scores and soundtracks due to its cinematic quality. (AI Generated)
