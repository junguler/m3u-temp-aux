Black metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that is characterized by its dark and aggressive sound, often featuring fast tempos, blast beats, and tremolo-picked guitar riffs. The lyrics typically focus on themes of Satanism, paganism, and anti-Christianity. The genre is known for its use of corpse paint and other theatrical elements in live performances. Bands in this genre often incorporate symphonic elements, such as orchestral arrangements and choirs, to create a grandiose and epic sound. (AI Generated)
