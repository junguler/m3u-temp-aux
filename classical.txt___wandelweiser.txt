Wandelweiser is a contemporary music genre that emphasizes silence, stillness, and simplicity. It often features long periods of silence, sustained tones, and delicate sounds produced by unconventional instruments or found objects. The genre values the listener's experience of the music as much as the sounds themselves, encouraging a meditative and contemplative state. (AI Generated)
