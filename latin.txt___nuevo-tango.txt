Nuevo tango is a modern interpretation of traditional Argentine tango music, incorporating elements of jazz, classical music, and electronic music. It is characterized by complex rhythms, unconventional harmonies, and virtuosic instrumental performances. The genre was popularized by a pioneering composer and bandone√≥n player in the 1950s and has since been embraced by a new generation of musicians who continue to push the boundaries of the genre.
