Melodic doom is a subgenre of doom metal that emphasizes melody and atmosphere over sheer heaviness. It often features slow, crushing riffs and mournful, melancholic vocals. The genre is characterized by its use of clean and distorted guitar tones, as well as the incorporation of keyboards and other atmospheric elements. October Tide, Marianas Rest, and Frayle are all examples of bands that incorporate these elements into their music, creating a sound that is both heavy and haunting. (AI Generated)
