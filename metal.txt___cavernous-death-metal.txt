Cavernous death metal is a subgenre of death metal that is characterized by its deep, guttural vocals, heavy use of distortion and reverb, and a focus on creating a dark and oppressive atmosphere. The music is often slow and plodding, with a focus on creating a sense of dread and foreboding. The lyrics often deal with themes of death, decay, and the occult. This genre is known for its use of low-tuned guitars and bass, as well as its reliance on blast beats and other extreme drumming techniques. (AI Generated)
