Afrobeat is a genre of music that originated in West Africa in the 1970s. It combines traditional African rhythms with funk, jazz, and soul influences. The music is characterized by its use of complex polyrhythms, heavy percussion, and call-and-response vocals. In recent years, the genre has seen a resurgence in popularity, with contemporary bands incorporating elements of afrobeat into their music. These bands often feature horn sections, funky bass lines, and driving rhythms that are reminiscent of the classic afrobeat sound. (AI Generated)
