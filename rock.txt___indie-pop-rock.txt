Indie pop rock is a genre that blends elements of indie rock and pop music, creating a sound that is both catchy and introspective. The music often features jangly guitars, upbeat rhythms, and melodic vocals that explore themes of love, loss, and self-discovery. This genre is known for its DIY ethos and independent spirit, with many artists eschewing major labels in favor of self-releasing their music. The genre has seen a resurgence in recent years, with bands like Cavedoll, Heavy Young Heathens, and Rumspringa leading the charge with their unique takes on the indie pop rock sound. (AI Generated)
