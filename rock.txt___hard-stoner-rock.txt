Hard stoner rock is a subgenre of rock music that combines heavy, distorted guitar riffs with a slow, groovy tempo. The genre is characterized by its use of psychedelic and bluesy elements, as well as its focus on creating a thick, wall-of-sound texture. Zebulon, Waxy, and Shovelhead are all examples of bands that embody the hard stoner rock sound, with their heavy, fuzzed-out guitars and driving rhythms. The music is often associated with a rebellious, countercultural attitude and a love of all things loud and heavy. (AI Generated)
