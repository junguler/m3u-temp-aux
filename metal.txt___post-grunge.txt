Post-grunge is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged in the mid-1990s. It is characterized by heavy guitar riffs, angst-filled lyrics, and a generally more polished sound than its predecessor, grunge. Post-grunge bands often incorporate elements of hard rock and metal into their music, resulting in a more aggressive and energetic sound. The genre gained popularity in the early 2000s, with bands like Linkin Park, Foo Fighters, and Nickelback leading the charge. (AI Generated)
