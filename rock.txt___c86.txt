C86 is a music genre that emerged in the mid-1980s in the UK. It is characterized by jangly guitars, upbeat melodies, and DIY production. The genre was named after a cassette compilation released by the NME magazine in 1986. C86 bands often had a lo-fi sound and were influenced by 1960s pop and punk rock. The lyrics were often introspective and dealt with everyday life. The Primitives, The Go-Betweens, and Heavenly were all part of the C86 scene and helped to define the genre. (AI Generated)
