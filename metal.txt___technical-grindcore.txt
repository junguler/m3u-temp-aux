Technical grindcore is a subgenre of extreme metal that combines the fast-paced, aggressive sound of grindcore with complex, intricate musical arrangements. The music is characterized by lightning-fast blast beats, dissonant guitar riffs, and guttural vocals that often touch on themes of social and environmental issues. Bands in this genre often incorporate elements of jazz, progressive rock, and other experimental genres into their music, resulting in a sound that is both chaotic and highly technical.
