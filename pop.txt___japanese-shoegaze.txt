Japanese shoegaze is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is characterized by its use of heavily distorted guitars, ethereal vocals, and a wall of sound production style. The genre is known for its dreamy, introspective sound and often incorporates elements of noise rock and post-punk. Japanese shoegaze has gained a cult following in recent years, with bands like Hitsujibungaku, Kinokoteikoku, and MASS OF THE FERMENTING DREGS becoming popular both in Japan and internationally.
