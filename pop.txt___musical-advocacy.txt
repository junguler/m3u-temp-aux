Musical advocacy is a genre that aims to raise awareness and funds for social and humanitarian causes through music. It often involves collaborations between various artists and the proceeds from the music are donated to the cause. The genre gained popularity in the 1980s with the release of charity singles like Band Aid and U.S.A. For Africa, which aimed to combat famine in Africa. In recent years, Band Aid 30 was released to raise funds for the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. The genre continues to be a powerful tool for social change and has inspired many other charity singles and concerts. (AI Generated)
