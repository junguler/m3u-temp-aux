Canto a tenore is a traditional style of polyphonic singing from Sardinia, Italy. It involves four male singers who use their voices to create a unique harmony of sounds, including a deep bass, a high-pitched voice, and two intermediate voices. The music is characterized by its haunting melodies and intricate rhythms, which are often accompanied by traditional instruments such as the launeddas (a type of reed instrument). (AI Generated)
