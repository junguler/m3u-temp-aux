Shamanic music is a genre that draws inspiration from traditional indigenous cultures and their spiritual practices. It often features repetitive rhythms, chants, and sounds that are believed to induce a trance-like state and connect the listener to the divine. The music is intended to facilitate healing, transformation, and a deeper connection to nature and the cosmos. It can be both meditative and energizing, with a focus on the power of the human voice and the use of natural instruments such as drums, rattles, and flutes. (AI Generated)
