The new wave of glam metal is a subgenre that combines the theatricality and flamboyance of classic glam rock with the heavy guitar riffs and catchy hooks of traditional metal. This style is characterized by its high-energy performances, flashy costumes, and anthemic choruses that are designed to get crowds singing along. The lyrics often focus on themes of partying, love, and rebellion, and the music is meant to be enjoyed with a beer in hand and a fist in the air. (AI Generated)
