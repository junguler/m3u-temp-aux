Northern soul is a music genre that emerged in the 1960s in northern England. It is characterized by a fast-paced beat, heavy use of horns and strings, and soulful vocals. The genre gained popularity among working-class youth who were drawn to its energetic dance rhythms and the emotional intensity of the lyrics. Northern soul often features lesser-known American soul tracks that were not widely played in the US, as well as rare B-sides and obscure recordings. The genre has a dedicated following and continues to influence contemporary music. (AI Generated)
