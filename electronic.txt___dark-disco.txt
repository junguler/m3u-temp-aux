Dark disco is a genre that blends disco beats with darker and more atmospheric elements, often featuring haunting vocals and pulsing synths. It has a distinct retro feel, but with a modern twist. The music is perfect for dancing, but also has a moody, introspective quality that sets it apart from traditional disco. (AI Generated)
