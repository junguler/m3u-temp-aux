Bahamian folk music is a genre that incorporates African rhythms and European melodies. It often features call-and-response vocals and the use of traditional instruments such as the goat skin drum, saw, and shak-shak. The lyrics often tell stories of everyday life in the Bahamas, including fishing, farming, and social issues. The genre gained popularity in the 1950s and 1960s with the emergence of calypso music, which was performed at the Royal Victoria Hotel in Nassau. Today, Bahamian folk music continues to be an important part of the country's cultural heritage. (AI Generated)
