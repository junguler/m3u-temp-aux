Field recording is a music genre that involves capturing sounds from the natural environment and incorporating them into compositions. This genre often features ambient and experimental elements, and can create a unique sonic landscape that transports the listener to a different place or time. Some artists in this genre use field recordings exclusively, while others blend them with traditional musical instruments and electronic sounds. The resulting music can be haunting, beautiful, and thought-provoking. (AI Generated)
