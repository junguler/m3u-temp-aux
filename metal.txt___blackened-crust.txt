Blackened crust is a subgenre of crust punk that incorporates elements of black metal, resulting in a darker and more aggressive sound. The music is characterized by fast, distorted guitars, harsh vocals, and a raw, lo-fi production style. The lyrics often deal with themes of social and political unrest, as well as personal struggles and nihilism. The genre has gained popularity in recent years, with bands like Darkthrone, Hexis, and Devil Master leading the charge. (AI Generated)
