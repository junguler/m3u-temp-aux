The music is characterized by fast-paced guitar riffs, powerful vocals, and complex drumming. It often features lyrics that address social and political issues, as well as themes related to Brazilian culture and history. The genre gained international recognition in the 1990s with the emergence of bands such as Sepultura, ANGRA, and Oficina G3. (AI Generated)
