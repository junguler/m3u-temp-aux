Grunge pop is a music genre that combines the raw, distorted sound of grunge with the catchy hooks and melodic sensibilities of pop. The music often features heavy guitar riffs, driving rhythms, and angst-filled lyrics that touch on themes of alienation, disillusionment, and social commentary. Bands in this genre often incorporate elements of punk, alternative rock, and metal into their sound, creating a unique blend of styles that appeals to fans of both heavy and melodic music.
