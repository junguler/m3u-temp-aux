The New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) was a music movement that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the UK. It was characterized by fast-paced, guitar-driven heavy metal with a focus on melody and powerful vocals. The genre was known for its raw, energetic sound and DIY ethos, with many bands self-releasing their music and touring extensively. The NWOBHM had a significant impact on the development of heavy metal, and its influence can still be heard in modern metal music. (AI Generated)
