2-step music is a subgenre of UK garage that emerged in the late 1990s. It is characterized by a syncopated beat pattern with a kick on the first and third beat and a snare or clap on the second and fourth beat, creating a distinctive "step" rhythm. The genre also incorporates elements of soul, R&B, and hip hop, with chopped and pitched vocal samples often used as a prominent feature. (AI Generated)
