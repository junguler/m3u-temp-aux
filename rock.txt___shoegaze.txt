Shoegaze is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is characterized by ethereal and dreamy soundscapes created through the use of heavily distorted guitars, reverb, and delay effects. The genre often features hushed vocals that blend into the instrumentation, creating a hypnotic and immersive listening experience. Shoegaze is known for its introspective and melancholic lyrics, which often explore themes of love, loss, and nostalgia. (AI Generated)
