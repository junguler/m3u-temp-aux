Blackened deathcore is a subgenre of extreme metal that combines elements of death metal, black metal, and metalcore. It is characterized by its aggressive and fast-paced instrumentation, heavy use of blast beats, breakdowns, and dissonant guitar riffs. The vocals are typically guttural and growled, with occasional high-pitched screams. The lyrics often deal with themes of darkness, despair, and nihilism. (AI Generated)
