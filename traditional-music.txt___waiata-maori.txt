Waiata Maori is a traditional music genre that originates from the indigenous people of New Zealand. It is characterized by the use of Maori language and traditional instruments such as the poi and the haka. The music often tells stories of love, loss, and the connection to the land. In recent years, contemporary artists have infused modern elements into the genre, resulting in a fusion of traditional and contemporary sounds. (AI Generated)
