Blackened hardcore is a subgenre of hardcore punk that incorporates elements of black metal, resulting in a darker and more aggressive sound. It is characterized by its use of dissonant guitar riffs, blast beats, and screamed vocals. The lyrics often deal with themes of despair, nihilism, and existentialism. Bands in this genre typically have a raw and intense live performance, with a focus on creating a chaotic and cathartic atmosphere. (AI Generated)
