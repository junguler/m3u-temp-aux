Drone metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that emphasizes the use of sustained or repeated notes, creating a hypnotic and meditative atmosphere. It often features slow, heavy riffs and a focus on texture and soundscapes rather than melody or traditional song structure. The genre is known for its use of distortion, feedback, and other effects to create a wall of sound that can be both overwhelming and trance-inducing. (AI Generated)
