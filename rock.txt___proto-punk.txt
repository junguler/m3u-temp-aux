Proto-punk music is a raw and rebellious predecessor to the punk rock movement, emerging in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Characterized by its stripped-down instrumentation, aggressive energy, and anti-establishment lyrics, proto-punk laid the groundwork for the later punk explosion. It often incorporated elements from garage rock, art rock, and rock 'n' roll, creating a distinct sound that challenged musical norms and inspired a new wave of musicians to embrace a DIY ethic.
