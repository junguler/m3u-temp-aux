Prepared piano music is a genre that involves altering the sound of a piano by placing various objects on or between the strings, hammers, and dampers. This creates a unique and often percussive sound that is different from traditional piano music. The genre has been explored by many contemporary composers and performers, and often incorporates elements of experimental, ambient, and electronic music. The resulting compositions can be both haunting and beautiful, and push the boundaries of what is possible with a piano. (AI Generated)
