Tech trance is a subgenre of trance music that combines the driving beats and basslines of techno with the melodic and uplifting elements of trance. It is characterized by its fast tempo, heavy use of percussion and synth stabs, and a focus on creating a hypnotic and energetic atmosphere on the dancefloor. The genre has gained popularity in recent years with artists such as Tempo Giusto, Dennis Sheperd, and Maarten de Jong leading the charge with their innovative and dynamic productions.
