Post-punk is a genre of music that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is characterized by its use of punk rock's DIY ethos and energy, combined with a more experimental and artful approach to songwriting and production. Post-punk often features angular guitar riffs, driving basslines, and propulsive drumming, as well as atmospheric synths and other electronic elements. The lyrics often explore themes of alienation, disillusionment, and social critique. Some of the most influential bands in the post-punk movement include Talking Heads, New Order, and Joy Division.
