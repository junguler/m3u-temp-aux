Norwegian metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that emerged in Norway during the 1980s. It is characterized by its dark and aggressive sound, often incorporating elements of black metal and symphonic metal. The lyrics often touch on themes of Norse mythology, paganism, and anti-Christianity. The genre gained international attention in the 1990s with the rise of bands such as Dimmu Borgir and Burzum. Today, Norwegian metal continues to evolve and innovate, with bands like Leprous pushing the boundaries of the genre. (AI Generated)
