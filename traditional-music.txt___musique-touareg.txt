Musique Touareg is a genre of music that originated from the Tuareg people of the Sahara desert. It is characterized by its use of traditional instruments such as the tinde drum and the imzad fiddle, as well as the incorporation of modern instruments like the electric guitar. The music often features call-and-response vocals and a hypnotic, trance-like rhythm. The lyrics often address themes of exile, political struggle, and the preservation of Tuareg culture.
