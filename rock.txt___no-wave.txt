No wave is an experimental music genre that emerged in the late 1970s in New York City. It is characterized by its rejection of traditional rock and punk conventions, incorporating elements of avant-garde, jazz, funk, and electronic music. No wave often features dissonant and abrasive sounds, unconventional song structures, and confrontational lyrics. It was a reaction against the commercialization of punk rock and sought to push the boundaries of what was considered "acceptable" in music. The genre influenced many artists and bands, including those who went on to become famous in the mainstream music industry. (AI Generated)
