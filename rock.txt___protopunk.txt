Protopunk is a music genre that emerged in the mid-1960s and early 1970s, characterized by its raw and aggressive sound, rebellious lyrics, and anti-establishment attitude. It is considered a precursor to punk rock and often features distorted guitars, driving rhythms, and confrontational vocals. Protopunk bands often rejected the polished production values of mainstream rock and instead embraced a more stripped-down, DIY approach. The genre was influential in shaping the sound of punk and post-punk music that followed. (AI Generated)
