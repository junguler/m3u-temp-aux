Melodic groove metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that combines the melodic elements of traditional heavy metal with the groove and rhythmic intensity of thrash metal. The genre is characterized by its heavy use of palm-muted riffs, syncopated rhythms, and aggressive vocals. The music often features complex guitar solos and harmonies, as well as electronic elements such as synthesizers and samples. The lyrics often deal with themes of social and political issues, personal struggles, and the human condition. (AI Generated)
