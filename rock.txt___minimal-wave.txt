Minimal wave is a subgenre of post-punk and new wave music that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is characterized by its use of synthesizers, drum machines, and other electronic instruments to create a cold, detached sound. The lyrics often deal with themes of alienation, isolation, and despair. Minimal wave has experienced a resurgence in popularity in recent years, with many contemporary artists drawing inspiration from the genre's pioneering acts. (AI Generated)
