Tolkien metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that draws inspiration from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, particularly The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. The music often features epic, symphonic arrangements, with lyrics that tell stories of battles, quests, and mythical creatures. The genre is characterized by its use of folk instruments, such as flutes and bagpipes, and its incorporation of elements of Nordic and Viking metal. (AI Generated)
