American shoegaze is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is characterized by its use of heavily distorted guitars, ethereal vocals, and a focus on creating a dreamy, atmospheric sound. The genre is often associated with introspective lyrics and a sense of melancholy. Bands in this genre typically use effects pedals to create a wall of sound that envelops the listener.
