Mod revival is a music genre that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the UK. It is characterized by its revival of the mod subculture of the 1960s, which was known for its fashion, scooters, and love of soul, R&B, and beat music. The music of mod revival bands often features catchy guitar riffs, driving rhythms, and socially conscious lyrics. The genre reached its peak in the early 1980s and has since influenced a number of other genres, including Britpop. (AI Generated)
