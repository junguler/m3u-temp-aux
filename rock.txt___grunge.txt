Grunge music is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged in the Pacific Northwest in the mid-1980s. It is characterized by its heavy, distorted guitar sound and angst-filled lyrics that often deal with themes of social alienation and apathy. Grunge music is known for its raw, unpolished sound and DIY ethos, which helped to define the genre's anti-establishment attitude. It gained mainstream popularity in the early 1990s with bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and The Smashing Pumpkins, who helped to bring grunge to a wider audience. (AI Generated)
