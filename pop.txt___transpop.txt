Transpop is a genre of music that combines elements of pop, electronic, and dance music with themes of gender identity and queer culture. It often features high-pitched vocals, heavy use of synthesizers and drum machines, and upbeat, danceable rhythms. The lyrics often explore topics such as self-discovery, empowerment, and acceptance. The genre has gained popularity in recent years with the rise of transgender and non-binary artists who use their music to express their identities and experiences. (AI Generated)
