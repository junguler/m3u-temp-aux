Blackgaze is a subgenre of post-metal and shoegaze that combines the atmospheric and dreamy sounds of shoegaze with the harsh and aggressive elements of black metal. The genre often features distorted guitars, blast beats, and screamed vocals, but also incorporates clean singing and ethereal melodies. The lyrics often deal with themes of isolation, depression, and existentialism. (AI Generated)
