Sovietwave is a subgenre of electronic music that emerged in the late 2010s. It incorporates elements of post-punk, new wave, and synth-pop, while also drawing inspiration from Soviet-era aesthetics and culture. The music often features melancholic and introspective lyrics, with a focus on themes of nostalgia, isolation, and disillusionment. The sound is characterized by its use of vintage synthesizers, drum machines, and lo-fi production techniques, giving it a distinctly retro and atmospheric feel. (AI Generated)
