Russian power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that incorporates elements of classical music, symphonic metal, and traditional Russian folk music. It is characterized by fast-paced, melodic guitar riffs, soaring vocals, and epic, cinematic arrangements. The lyrics often deal with themes of heroism, mythology, and history, and are sung in Russian. Bands in this genre often use orchestral instruments such as strings and horns to create a grandiose sound. (AI Generated)
