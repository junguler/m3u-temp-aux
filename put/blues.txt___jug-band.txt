Jug band music is a genre that emerged in the early 1900s in the southern United States. It features a mix of traditional folk, blues, and jazz styles, played on homemade instruments such as jugs, washboards, and kazoos. The music is often upbeat and lively, with lyrics that tell stories of everyday life. Jug bands were popular in the 1920s and 30s, but the genre has seen a resurgence in recent years with contemporary artists putting their own spin on the classic sound. (AI Generated)
