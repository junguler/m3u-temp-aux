Austro-German modernism is a music genre that emerged in the early 20th century, characterized by atonality, dissonance, and experimentation with new forms and techniques. Composers in this movement sought to break away from traditional tonal structures and explore new ways of expressing emotion and meaning through music. This genre was heavily influenced by the political and social upheavals of the time, including the rise of fascism and the devastation of World War I. (AI Generated)
