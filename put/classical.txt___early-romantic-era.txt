The early Romantic era music genre was characterized by a focus on individual expression and emotion, as well as a departure from the strict rules of classical music. This period saw the development of new forms such as the character piece and the song cycle, as well as an emphasis on virtuosity and technical skill. The music was often highly emotional and introspective, with themes of love, nature, and the supernatural. (AI Generated)
