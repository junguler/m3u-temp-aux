Balochi folk music is a traditional genre that originates from the Balochistan region, spanning across Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan. It is characterized by the use of unique instruments such as the soroz (a type of flute), benju (a stringed instrument), and do-tar (a two-stringed lute). The music often features poetic lyrics that reflect the daily life, culture, and traditions of the Baloch people. The genre has gained popularity in recent years, with contemporary artists incorporating modern elements into their music while still maintaining the traditional sound. (AI Generated)
