Psychedelic soul is a genre that combines the soulful vocals and instrumentation of classic soul music with the experimental, trippy sounds of psychedelic rock. It often features distorted guitars, funky basslines, and swirling organs, as well as socially conscious lyrics that address issues like racism and inequality. The genre emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s and has seen a resurgence in recent years, with contemporary artists blending elements of psychedelic soul with modern production techniques.
