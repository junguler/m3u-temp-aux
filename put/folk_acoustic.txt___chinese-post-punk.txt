Chinese post-punk is a genre that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, heavily influenced by the punk movement in the West. It is characterized by its raw, minimalist sound, often featuring distorted guitars, driving basslines, and frenetic drumming. The lyrics often touch on themes of social and political commentary, as well as personal struggles and emotions. Today, the genre continues to evolve and thrive in China, with a new wave of bands incorporating traditional Chinese instruments and melodies into their music. (AI Generated)
