Rune folk music is a genre that draws inspiration from ancient Nordic and Scandinavian cultures. It features haunting vocals, traditional instruments such as the Nordic lute and the tagelharpa, and atmospheric soundscapes created using natural elements like stones, water, and fire. The lyrics often explore themes of mythology, nature, and spirituality, and are sung in Old Norse or other ancient languages. The music is characterized by its raw, primal energy and its ability to transport listeners to a different time and place. (AI Generated)
