Necrotrap is a subgenre of trap music that combines dark, haunting melodies with heavy bass and distorted vocals. The lyrics often touch on themes of death, horror, and the supernatural. The sound is characterized by eerie soundscapes, glitchy beats, and a general sense of unease. It's a genre that's not for the faint of heart, but for those who enjoy exploring the darker side of music. (AI Generated)
