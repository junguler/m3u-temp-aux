Vaporwave is a genre of music that emerged in the early 2010s and is characterized by its use of slowed-down, chopped-up samples of 80s and 90s pop, funk, and R&B music. The genre often incorporates elements of smooth jazz, ambient music, and new age music, and is known for its nostalgic, dreamy, and surreal soundscapes. Vaporwave has gained a cult following among internet subcultures and is often associated with themes of consumerism, capitalism, and the internet age. (AI Generated)
