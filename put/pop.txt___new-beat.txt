New beat is a genre of electronic dance music that emerged in the late 1980s in Belgium. It is characterized by its slow, pounding beats, heavy use of sampling and synthesizers, and a dark, industrial sound. The genre was popularized by a group of Belgian DJs and producers who experimented with mixing and manipulating existing tracks to create a new sound. New beat was influential in the development of techno and house music, and its legacy can still be heard in contemporary electronic dance music. (AI Generated)
