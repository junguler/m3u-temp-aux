Focus trance is a genre of electronic dance music that features hypnotic rhythms and melodic patterns. It is characterized by its ability to create a trance-like state in the listener, allowing them to focus and lose themselves in the music. The genre often incorporates elements of progressive house and techno, with a focus on building tension and releasing it through climactic drops. The use of atmospheric sounds and ethereal vocals adds to the otherworldly feel of the music. (AI Generated)
