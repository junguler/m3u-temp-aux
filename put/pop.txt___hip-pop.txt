Hip hop music is a genre that originated in African American and Latino communities in the United States during the 1970s. It is characterized by its rhythmic beats, spoken word lyrics, and electronic instrumentation. In recent years, hip hop has become more mainstream and has incorporated elements of pop music, resulting in a subgenre known as hip pop. This style often features catchy hooks, upbeat tempos, and collaborations with popular singers. Some of the most successful hip pop artists include those who have crossed over into mainstream pop culture, such as those who have been featured on reality TV shows or have become brand ambassadors for major companies.
