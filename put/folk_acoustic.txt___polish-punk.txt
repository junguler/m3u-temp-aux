Polish punk music is a subgenre of punk rock that emerged in Poland in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is characterized by fast-paced guitar riffs, aggressive vocals, and politically charged lyrics that often criticize the government and social issues. The genre gained popularity during the Solidarity movement in the 1980s and has since evolved to include various subgenres such as ska punk and pop punk.
