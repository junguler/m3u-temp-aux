Plunderphonics is a genre of music that involves taking pre-existing audio recordings and manipulating them to create something new. This can involve sampling, cutting, and rearranging different sounds and songs to create a unique composition. The resulting music often has a nostalgic or retro feel, as it draws on familiar sounds and melodies from the past. Plunderphonics artists may also incorporate elements of electronic music, hip-hop, and other genres into their work. (AI Generated)
