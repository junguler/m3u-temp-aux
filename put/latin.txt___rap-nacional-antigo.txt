Rap Nacional Antigo is a Brazilian hip-hop subgenre that emerged in the 1990s and early 2000s. It is characterized by socially conscious lyrics that address issues such as poverty, violence, and inequality in Brazilian society. The music often features samples of Brazilian funk, samba, and other traditional genres, blended with electronic beats and scratching. The genre gained popularity among urban youth in Brazil, particularly in the favelas (slums) of major cities. (AI Generated)
