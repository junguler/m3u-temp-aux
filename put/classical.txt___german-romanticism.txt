German Romanticism was a musical movement that emerged in the late 18th century and continued through the mid-19th century. It was characterized by a focus on emotion, individualism, and the supernatural. Composers of this era often used unconventional harmonies and forms, and drew inspiration from literature and nature. The music of this period was often grand and dramatic, with a strong emphasis on melody and expression. (AI Generated)
