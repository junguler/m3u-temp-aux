Acid house is a subgenre of house music that originated in the 1980s. It is characterized by its use of the Roland TB-303 synthesizer, which produces a distinctive "acid" sound. Acid house tracks typically feature repetitive, hypnotic rhythms and heavily processed vocals. The genre was popularized in clubs in Chicago and London, and has since spread worldwide. Its influence can be heard in many forms of electronic dance music today. (AI Generated)
