Dub is a subgenre of reggae music that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. It is characterized by the use of heavy basslines, drum and bass rhythms, and the manipulation of sound effects and vocals through the use of mixing boards and other electronic equipment. Dub product music often features instrumental versions of popular reggae songs, with emphasis on the rhythm section and the use of echo and reverb effects. The Rockers All Stars, The Arabs, and The G.G. All Stars are all notable contributors to the dub product music genre. (AI Generated)
