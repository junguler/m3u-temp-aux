Spiritual jazz is a subgenre of jazz music that emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is characterized by its use of spiritual and religious themes, as well as its incorporation of non-Western musical elements. This genre often features improvisation, extended solos, and a focus on the exploration of sound and emotion. The use of instruments such as the harp, sitar, and African percussion is common. The music is often meditative and introspective, seeking to connect with a higher power or consciousness. (AI Generated)
