Musica Ayacuchana is a traditional music genre from the Andean region of Peru. It is characterized by its use of the charango, a small stringed instrument, and the hauntingly beautiful vocals that often accompany it. The music often tells stories of love, loss, and the struggles of life in the Andes.
