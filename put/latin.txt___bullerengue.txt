Bullerengue music is a traditional Afro-Colombian genre characterized by its lively rhythms, call-and-response vocals, and energetic percussion. It is deeply rooted in the cultural heritage of the African descendants in Colombia's Caribbean coast, incorporating elements of African, Indigenous, and Spanish music. Bullerengue songs often tell stories of everyday life, love, and spirituality, and are typically performed in a communal setting with dancers moving to the infectious beats. (AI Generated)
