J-punk is a subgenre of punk rock that originated in Japan in the late 1970s. It is characterized by fast-paced, energetic music with aggressive guitar riffs and lyrics that often address social and political issues. J-punk bands often incorporate elements of other genres, such as ska and pop, into their music. The genre experienced a resurgence in the 1990s and continues to be popular today, with bands like WANIMA, MONGOL800, and Hi-STANDARD leading the way. (AI Generated)
