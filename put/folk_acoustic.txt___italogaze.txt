Italogaze is a subgenre of shoegaze that originated in Italy in the late 2000s. It blends dreamy, atmospheric soundscapes with elements of post-punk and new wave. The music often features ethereal vocals and layers of distorted guitars, creating a hazy and introspective mood. Italogaze bands often draw inspiration from the 80s and 90s alternative music scene, while incorporating their own unique Italian flair. (AI Generated)
