Son Jarocho is a traditional music genre from Veracruz, Mexico, characterized by its use of stringed instruments such as the jarana, requinto, and harp, as well as percussive instruments like the quijada (jawbone of a donkey). The music is often accompanied by dancing and singing, and the lyrics often reflect themes of love, nature, and social justice. Son Jarocho has gained international recognition in recent years, with notable figures such as Salma Hayek promoting the genre. Los Cojolites and Son De Madera are two prominent groups within the Son Jarocho community. (AI Generated)
