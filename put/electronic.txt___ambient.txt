Ambient music is a genre characterized by its atmospheric and ethereal soundscapes. It often features minimalistic instrumentation, repetitive patterns, and a focus on texture and mood rather than melody or rhythm. The genre emerged in the 1970s and has since evolved to encompass a wide range of styles and approaches. Some of its key features include the use of electronic and acoustic instruments, field recordings, and the incorporation of natural sounds. Ambient music is often associated with relaxation, meditation, and contemplation, and has been used in a variety of settings, including film soundtracks, art installations, and therapeutic environments.
