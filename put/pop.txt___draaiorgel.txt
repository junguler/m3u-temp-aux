The music is created by turning a crank, which rotates a barrel with pins that pluck the organ's pipes. The genre is often associated with street performances and carnivals, and is popular in the Netherlands and Belgium. Some well-known examples of draaiorgel music include upbeat and lively tunes, while others are more traditional and nostalgic. (AI Generated)
