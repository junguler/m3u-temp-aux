Gregorian chant is a form of medieval plainchant that originated in the Catholic Church. It is characterized by a monophonic melody sung in unison by a choir of male voices, typically monks. The music is often sung in Latin and is intended to be meditative and contemplative. The genre has been preserved and performed by various religious orders throughout history, including the Monks of the Abbey of Notre Dame and Dom Le Feuvre. (AI Generated)
