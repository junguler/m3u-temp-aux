Beat poetry is a subgenre of spoken word poetry that emerged in the 1950s and 60s. It is characterized by its free-flowing, improvisational style and often deals with themes of social and political rebellion, drug use, and sexuality. Beat poets often performed their work accompanied by jazz or other forms of music, creating a unique fusion of poetry and music. The genre was popularized by a group of writers known as the Beat Generation, who rejected mainstream culture and sought to create a new, more authentic form of expression. (AI Generated)
