Salsa romántica is a subgenre of salsa music that emerged in the 1980s, characterized by its emphasis on romantic and sentimental themes. Unlike its more energetic and rhythm-driven counterpart, salsa dura, salsa romántica focuses on smooth melodies and often features lush, emotive vocals accompanied by orchestral arrangements. The lyrical content typically explores love, heartbreak, and relationships, making it a favorite for dancers who appreciate a gentler, more emotive style of salsa. (AI Generated)
