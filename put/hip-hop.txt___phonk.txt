Phonk is a subgenre of hip-hop that emerged in the early 2010s. It is characterized by its heavy use of chopped and screwed samples from old-school funk, soul, and R&B tracks, as well as its dark, lo-fi production style. Phonk often features slow, menacing beats and lyrics that focus on themes of violence, drug use, and street life. It has gained a cult following among fans of underground rap and trap music.
