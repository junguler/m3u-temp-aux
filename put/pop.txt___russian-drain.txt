Russian drain music is a subgenre of hip-hop that emerged in Russia in the early 2010s. It is characterized by its dark and melancholic sound, often featuring distorted and lo-fi beats, as well as introspective and emotional lyrics. The genre is heavily influenced by the Russian underground music scene and is often associated with themes of isolation, depression, and drug use. The artists who create this type of music often use pseudonyms and maintain a low profile, preferring to let their music speak for itself. (AI Generated)
