Japanese jazz fusion is a genre that combines elements of jazz, funk, and rock with traditional Japanese music. It is characterized by complex rhythms, virtuosic instrumental solos, and a fusion of electronic and acoustic sounds. The genre emerged in the 1970s and gained popularity in the 1980s with the rise of bands like CASIOPEA. Today, contemporary artists like Kan Sano and TENDRE continue to push the boundaries of Japanese jazz fusion, blending modern production techniques with traditional jazz instrumentation.
