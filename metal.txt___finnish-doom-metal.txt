Finnish doom metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that is characterized by slow, heavy, and melancholic music with lyrics that often explore themes of death, despair, and darkness. The music is typically driven by distorted guitars, heavy bass, and slow, pounding drums. The vocals are often deep and guttural, with occasional clean singing. Finnish doom metal bands often incorporate elements of other genres, such as black metal, gothic metal, and atmospheric music, to create a unique and haunting sound. (AI Generated)
