Pub rock is a British music genre that emerged in the early 1970s. It is characterized by its raw, stripped-down sound and its focus on live performances in small venues such as pubs. The genre draws influences from rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and country music. Its lyrics often deal with working-class themes and everyday life. Pub rock bands typically feature guitar, bass, drums, and occasionally keyboards. The genre had a significant impact on the punk rock movement that emerged later in the decade. (AI Generated)
