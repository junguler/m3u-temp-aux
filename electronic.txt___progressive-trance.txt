Progressive trance is a subgenre of trance music that is characterized by its melodic and uplifting sound. It typically features a slower tempo than other trance subgenres, with a focus on building a gradual progression of energy throughout the track. The genre often incorporates elements of house music, such as a four-on-the-floor beat and a strong emphasis on the bassline. Progressive trance is known for its emotional and atmospheric qualities, with soaring synths and ethereal vocals creating a dreamy and euphoric vibe. It has gained popularity in recent years with the rise of artists such as Above & Beyond, Seven Lions, and Tritonal. (AI Generated)
