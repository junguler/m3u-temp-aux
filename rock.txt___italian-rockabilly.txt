Italian rockabilly is a subgenre of rock and roll that emerged in Italy in the 1980s. It is characterized by its fusion of American rockabilly with Italian lyrics and influences from traditional Italian music. The music is often upbeat and energetic, with a focus on guitar-driven melodies and driving rhythms. Italian rockabilly artists often incorporate elements of swing, jazz, and blues into their music, creating a unique sound that is both nostalgic and modern. The genre has gained a following in Italy and around the world, with bands like William T., Jumpin'up, and Antonio Sorgentone leading the way. (AI Generated)
