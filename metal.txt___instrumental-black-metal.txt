Instrumental black metal is a subgenre of black metal that focuses on creating atmospheric and intense music without the use of vocals. The music often features fast-paced, tremolo-picked guitar riffs, blast beats, and atmospheric keyboards or synths. The lack of vocals allows for the music to be more immersive and allows the listener to focus on the intricate instrumentation and atmospheric elements. The genre often explores themes of darkness, despair, and the unknown. (AI Generated)
