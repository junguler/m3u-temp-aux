Serialism is a modernist music genre that emerged in the early 20th century. It is characterized by the use of a series of musical notes, or "tone row," which is then manipulated in various ways to create a structured and complex composition. This technique is often associated with atonality and the rejection of traditional tonal harmony. Serialism has been used by many composers, including those associated with the Second Viennese School and the Darmstadt School. It has also been influential in the development of electronic music and computer music. (AI Generated)
